# WhosGamingApp

WhosGaming is an application designed to replace that group chat we know that everyone of you have that consists of that nightly banter of "Anyone getting on tonight". With WhosGaming the teamleader of your group will setup and account with us. Then input all your fellow gamers phone numbers and set the time you want your daily text to be sent out asking who is playing as well as setting the time to send out the second text confirming how many gamers will be online.
